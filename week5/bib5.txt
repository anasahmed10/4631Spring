The world of digital media is evolving by utilizing the blockchain. Whereas high end art and other digital media was previously auctioned off with original artwork, a new way to digitize art called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has arrived. Using the Ethereum blockchain, buyers can purchase a physical copy of the work which also arrives with a slip that verifies that the NFT has been recorded on the blockchain. If the work is valuable, the NFT will go up in value similar to a cryptocurrency. Not all NFTs are equal though; different works may fetch different values. A video of LeBron James dunking sold for $208,000. What separates NFTs from most cryptocurrencies is that NFTs are built on an already established blockchain: Ethereum. So in purchasing NFTs, the consumer is not gambling on the quality of the blockchain. If NFTs were established on a blockchain built from scratch, there would be doubts to the optimization of the block chain. In an age where technology has devalued digital media, NFTs could start a new era of art collection.

Chipmaker NVIDIA has been experiencing a shortage in graphic processing units (GPUs). The cause for the companyâ€™s stock shortage has been attributed to two groups: miners and scalpers. As their next-generation GPUs had a nearly 70% increase in performance, they have become desirable for mining cryptocurrency. To combat these miners, NVIDIA has implemented a software limiter in their drivers. There have been doubts to the efficiency of this method as miners normally write their own software in order to maximize mining output. Another product NVIDIA believes will help is the CMP: Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, a processor dedicated specifically dedicated for mining. Only time will tell as if the CMP is less effective than GPUs for mining, miners will flock to GPUs instead.
