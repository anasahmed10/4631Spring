Big tech’s newest social media app has just come to China. Clubhouse, is a social networking app where famous individuals can host rooms and discuss various topics. The app is currently invite-only as only rich or famous individuals are allowed to use the app. Not only famous individuals, but businessmen also use the app to open rooms and share ideas with one another. With China now allowing a userbase on the app, the concern follows how the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) will censor users as there have already been various discussions on the app mentioning content which the CCP does not allow. Despite these concerns, the app is performing very efficiently in China with minimal app errors.
UPDATE: As of February 8, 2021, Clubhouse has been banned in China

Bitcoin is becoming the standard of cryptocurrency and Tesla’s latest investment may confirm this. The company invested $1.5B in bitcoin as it disclosed in an SEC filing. Clearly Elon Musk views Bitcoin as the digital currency of the future, but it is not the only cryptocurrency Musk has invested in. Musk’s tweets have been promoting the latest cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. Dogecoin being a cryptocurrency that Reddit’s Wallstreetbets community was also attempting to inflate. It was originally believed that Musk was trying to promote Dogecoin to try and inflate it and then sell it off. This practice is known as a “pump and dump”, where investors mass-buy a stock to inflate the price of a stock, only to sell them post-inflation.
