Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been interested in creating a decentralized model for social media. With a decentralized model, no single entity would control a social media platform. Users would have the ability to select between certain algorithms that would recommend various content. The project has been codenamed Bluesky. There have been growing concerns regarding the dangers of unmonitored social media ever since the White House attack on Capitol Hill. With Facebook and Parler distributing misinformation that led to a group of pro-Trump rioters attacking the US Capitol, it is refreshing to see Jack Dorsey attempt to strive for a better standard for social media.

A study has shown that Apple Watches could flag potential COVID-19 cases a week sooner than traditional PCR tests. The “Warrior Watch Study” used Apple Watches to track the conditions of several hundred healthcare workers between April and September 2020. Each Watch would measure heart rate variability, which is a key indication of nervous system sickness. Although this study could prove to be a breakthrough in the process of reporting COVID-19, it is worth noting that the accuracy in these tests has been in question. As there are a large number of smart wearables on the market (not just the Apple Watch), making a consistent testing standard for all devices may prove to be a challenge. Despite these drawbacks, smart wearables could play a large role in disease detection in the future if any new epidemic begins.
