Yardscape Summary:
The goal of my project was to create a marketplace app dedicated towards yard sales. The goal of this app was to build a complete platform, equipped
with an account system, as well as having all the listings stored on the cloud. I accomplished this using Google's Firebase API which allowed for 
everything to be handled through Google's servers. Alternative approaches to this problem would have been to create a more limited app, but I 
wanted to make this app with scalability in mind. Meaning that I could expand on this app without having to completely rewrite the source code. 
After Mobile App Programming I, I completely reworked the UI using fragments instead of activities in order to optimize the app. The changes I made are vastly improved compared to my Mobile App Programming I submission.
I believe this was the best approach as I am very proud of how this app turned out. Users can create accounts using their Google accounts.

Build/Installation Instructions:
Launch the debug.apk, if that does not work then launch the project in Android studio and build and run it.
Once the app is started, click the Google Sign in Button to sign into the app.
