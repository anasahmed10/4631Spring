Two titans in the tech industry are currently locked in a privacy battle. Apple recently made an update to their iOS operating system making certain apps ask for certain data-collecting permissions. Apple CEO Tim Cook says, “It is long past time to stop pretending that this approach doesn’t come with a cost — of polarization, of lost trust and, yes, of violence,”. Cook may be referencing the attacks on the US Capitol as Facebook played a large role in distributing disinformation in addition to “unknowingly” hosting numerous hate groups that played a role in the attack. Apple made a very wise move doing this despite the financial implications. Facebook often engages in mass data collection of users and reports have even been published stating that Facebook and Google have been working together on advertising.

An investment app once thought to “democratize stock trading” seems to have fallen to the other side. Robinhood, a common gateway to investing for a lot of people, halted the ability to buy stocks of GameStop for its users. Reddit users were massively buying GameStop shares to raise the price of the stock. In raising the stock, the hedge fund Citadel, who shorted the stock, will lose money. Such predatory practices have been used by billionaires since the stock market’s conception. Robinhood then shut down the ability to buy stocks, but kept the ability to sell stocks, hoping that the public would sell all their GameStop stock, thus dropping the price back. This is textbook market manipulation as users only had the choice of selling the stock.
