Microsoft and Google both testified to the Senate today pertaining to Google’s dominance of the news market. Microsoft argues that Google has led to the destruction of local journalism. Their argument is "But as we learned first-hand from Microsoft's own experience two decades ago, when a company's success creates side effects that adversely impact a market and our society, the problem should not be ignored. And this typically requires government action.". Google has detested this, claiming Microsoft has gone back to its Anti-Google roots. Microsoft has endorsed a bill that would give news publishers a chance to negotiate for revenue against tech giants. Google normally has all the leverage when negotiating with news media companies as they are the most popular browser and search engine.

Major progress has just been made for increasing 5G coverage around the US. Spectrum, the real estate for the US Government for auction off land for carriers has concluded as cell companies have updated their shareholders on the results. Spectrum is important as cell companies will use this land to build more 5G infrastructure. Verizon spent $52.9 billion to bolster their 5G by more than double. AT&T expects to spend between $6 and $8 billion to boost their network. Fortunately for T-Mobile, acquiring Sprint has allowed them an advantage as they have access to all of Sprint’s 5G infrastructure, so they only spent $9.3 billion. These moves show that cell companies are now betting against each other, waiting to see which 5G infrastructure reigns supreme.
