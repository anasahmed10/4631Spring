Microsoft may have just given the public a glimpse of what could be the future of computing. The company unveiled its new platform for mixed reality titled Mesh, capable of VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Alternate Reality). Having multiple users wearing headsets in the same room, the users would be able to see rendered digital objects in open space. Mesh is founded on three main elements, Azure, software optimization, and Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft has been working on their HoloLens platform since 2016, so the company has been working on the technology for 5 years. Mesh also plans to use Azure, the company’s cloud platform to help with some of the computing required to run the software. Microsoft has experience with this as they used Azure for cloud computing for their Xbox systems. Azure would help optimize rendering for the games. With the HoloLens currently built on Windows 10, it stands to reason that Microsoft could be working on porting Windows 10 to Mesh allowing for consumers to use computers for general use in a mixed reality environment.

Uber’s Robotics company has branched off into Serve Robotics. Serve had a working version of a sidewalk delivery robot in 2017 and proceeded to update it with superior sensors in 2019. The company began piloting their drones for delivery in the Los Angeles area in 2020. Next, is the plan to expand their fleet, hoping to account for 5% of food deliveries in the area. Uber could potentially save money from paying drivers and having drones handle smaller city deliveries instead. With cities having peak demand, if the company can send drones out for short deliveries, they would save the money of having to pay drivers in the city. Shifting to drones for short deliveries may be cheaper, but the initiative has not been active long enough to have the costs of repairs mapped out.
