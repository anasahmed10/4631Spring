States have been imposing new regulations on Big Tech companies. Virginia is following California in passing a data privacy law. The data privacy law, which was enacted originally by California, gives citizens the option to not allow companies to sell their personal information. This is one of the biggest sources of income for companies like Google and Facebook which uses users’ data to sell to advertisers. This model is one of the significant sources of a company like Google’s income, but now their parent company Alphabet is so dominant they have many streams of revenue. This law being enacted on a state level means that it will not make a big change in advertiser revenue unless it were to be passed on a federal level. This step for privacy is an important step for Americans concerned about their privacy, while many may not even notice the difference.

The ride sharing/food delivery app Uber recently had a major ruling in the UK concerning their employees. To cut costs, Uber would treat their drivers as self-employed gig workers, meaning that Uber was not obligated to pay benefits such as minimum wage, overtime, and health insurance. Yaseen Aslam, a former Uber driver who was one of the two who brought the suit noted "We're seeing many of our members earning £30 gross a day right now,". This decision may have implications for a similar case for one of Uber Eats’ competitors, Doordash. There is currently a class action against Doordash, who classified their employees as independent contractors in order to avoid paying them proper wages. This decision seems to have backfired as now Doordash has to individually settle cases with over 5000 individuals, in addition to a $1900 fee per settlement. This decision will mark a major shift in the employment model for these “gig” apps as they will have to be classified as regular jobs.
