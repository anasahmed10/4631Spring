Amazon has opened their first cashierless grocery store outside the United States in the United Kingdom. The store has the motto: “Just Walk Out” as the AI system keeps track of items in the cart. Upon leaving the store, the order is placed on the customers Amazon account from the cart. With social distancing, these Amazon stores could foreshadow the future of grocery shopping. There are ethical concerns with the jobs that would be closed down but the store still needs employees for jobs like stocking shelves, taking inventory, etc. With AI carts it is safe to say grocery shopping could be the next industry to be disrupted by tech.

Google is planning to reduce fees for putting apps on the Play Store. This decision could be a result of the lawsuit that Epic Games was in with Apple that caused the company to slash its royalty rate for smaller developers. Epic Games’ complaint was that they had to pay Apple 30% of any in-app purchases despite the purchases all being made on Epic Games’ own store. Google seems inspired by this as their plan will take a 15% cut from the first $1m in sales each year rather than 30%. There are anti-trust lawsuits with Google and Apple concerning their app stores and this move could be made in attempt to appease lawmakers. Currently, the iOS and Google Play stores are the only official app marketplaces for their perspective platforms so it could be completely possible that more anti-trust options act allowing for competing app stores on the same operating system.
